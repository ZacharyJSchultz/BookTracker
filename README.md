# Purpose:

## The goal of this project is to create a website seamlessly integrated with a functional back-end database. In particular, I would like to practice/advance my web development and database management skills, as well as learning about commonly used frameworks and gaining experience working with new DBMSs. Lastly, I also want to gain experience creating a fully-functional project from scratch, encompassing multiple different components (in this case, a front-end website and back-end databse).
